# idea for codefundo++

We are planning to build a secure, transparent and fast online voting system for an organization using Azure blockchain.
We will be using a private blockchain on Ethereum. There will be an administrative node which will authenticate and add other nodes on the network. Each member of the organization will get an Ethereum Account ID and password from the administrator(the password will be changed after every election). The account ID's which can participate will be whitelisted by the administrator so that only verified accounts can join the private network. Voting will be allowed for a set time period(which will be implemented using smart contracts). The results will be announced as soon as the time period ends.  This will result in a faster voting process and as every transaction(or vote) is stored on the network, there will be transparency. We will be using Azure Blockchain Workbench and Ethereum for this project.
